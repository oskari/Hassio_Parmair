## 0.2.0 - Control Features & Localization (2025-12-27)

### Added
- **Number Platform** with 5 controllable entities:
  - Home Speed Preset (0-4)
  - Away Speed Preset (0-4)
  - Boost Setting (2-4)
  - Exhaust Temperature Setpoint (18-26°C)
  - Supply Temperature Setpoint (15-25°C)
- **Switch Platform** with 3 toggle entities:

  - Time Program Enable/Disable
  - Heater Enable/Disable
- **Finnish Translation** (fi.json) for complete localization support
- Write capability via coordinator.async_write_register() method
- New register definitions: REG_SUMMER_MODE (1079), REG_TIME_PROGRAM_ENABLE (1108), REG_HEATER_ENABLE (1109)

### Changed
- Updated HACS metadata with "number" and "switch" domains
- Updated platform list in __init__.py to include Platform.NUMBER and Platform.SWITCH

## 0.1.13 - Branding Update (2025-12-27)

### Changed
- Updated integration name from "Parmair Ventilation" to "Parmair MAC" to align with official product naming
- Updated all references in documentation and user-facing strings
- Added disclaimer about project independence from Parmair

## 0.1.12 - Address Calculation Fix (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed off-by-one error in all register addresses
- Register ID + 1000 = Address (e.g., Register 20 = Address 1020, not 1019)
- All addresses were off by 1, preventing proper communication

## 0.1.11 - Register Documentation & Sensor Fixes (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Handle 65535 (0xFFFF) value for CO2 and humidity sensors (indicates sensor not installed)
- Corrected VENT_MACHINE register address from 1124 to 1243

### Changed
- Updated register documentation with official Parmair register IDs (TE01_M, TE10_M, etc.)
- All register definitions now use official IDs from Parmair documentation

## 0.1.10 - Register Address Fix (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed all Modbus register addresses by adding +1000 offset to match actual device addressing
- Register 20 is now correctly addressed as 1019 (not 19), register 124 as 1124, etc.
- This was the root cause preventing all sensor data from being read correctly
- Slave ID 0 should be used instead of default slave ID 1 for most devices

## 0.1.9 - Thread Safety & Auto-Detection (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Add threading lock to fix transaction ID mismatch errors causing sensor data loss.
- ModbusTcpClient is not thread-safe; now all Modbus operations are serialized with threading.Lock().
- Always create all sensor entities (show unavailable if data missing) instead of conditional creation.
- Improve diagnostic logging with failed register tracking and data key reporting.

### Added
- Automatic hardware model detection via VENT_MACHINE register (eliminates manual model selection).
- Enhanced logging showing which registers fail to read with addresses.

## 0.1.8 - Extended Legacy Compatibility (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Add `device_id` keyword argument as additional fallback layer in Modbus read/write methods, supporting extremely old pymodbus builds (pre-2.0 era).
- Improve compatibility chain: `unit` → `slave` → `device_id` → attribute assignment → positional arguments.
- Reference jormai/parmair implementation patterns for legacy client handling.

## 0.1.7 - Countless Legacy Clients (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Retry Modbus reads without a count parameter after assigning legacy attributes to support the oldest pymodbus variants.
- Accept primitive read responses when legacy clients do not expose a `registers` buffer.

## 0.1.6 - Legacy Attribute Fallback (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Assign the slave/unit id through client attributes before retrying Modbus calls so extremely old pymodbus clients work during setup and polling.
- Avoid calling `isError()` on result objects that do not expose the method, preventing AttributeError on legacy responses.

## 0.1.5 - Legacy Modbus Support (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Add positional Modbus read/write fallback so very old pymodbus clients lacking both `unit` and `slave` keywords still work during setup and runtime.

## 0.1.4 - Modbus Compatibility (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Restore compatibility with deployments running older pymodbus builds by falling back to the legacy `slave` keyword when `unit` is rejected during reads or writes.
- Prevent config flow connection tests from crashing with a `TypeError` when the Modbus client lacks `unit` support.

## 0.1.3 - Model-Aware Registers (2025-12-27)

### Added
- Register metadata definitions per hardware model with placeholder support for MAC150
- Config flow model selector to ensure correct register mapping on setup
- Extra diagnostics attributes exposing register ids, addresses, and model info on fan and sensors

### Changed
- Coordinator read/write logic now scales values using register definitions instead of hard-coded addresses

## 0.1.2 - Handler Compatibility (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Resolve "Invalid handler specified" by registering the config flow domain explicitly
- Refresh README and register map to drop classified documentation references

## 0.1.1 - Config Flow Fixes (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Allow Home Assistant OS 2025.12+ to reuse bundled `pymodbus>=3.11.2`
- Provide translations bundle required by 2025.12 config flow loader
- Register config flow handler correctly for Home Assistant 2025.12
