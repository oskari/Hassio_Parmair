## 0.7.7.2 - Documentation Cleanup (2026-01-05)

### Changed
- **Removed Modbus register addresses from all public documentation**
- Cleaned up CHANGELOG.md to remove technical register numbers
- README.md already clean (no register addresses)
- Register addresses remain in const.py for technical reference

### Rationale
- User-facing documentation should be clean and non-technical
- Register addresses are implementation details
- Improves readability for end users
- Technical details preserved in code comments

### Technical
- No code changes
- Documentation-only update
- Register addresses still defined in const.py

## 0.7.7.1 - Make Current Speed Sensor Numeric (2026-01-05)

### Changed
- **Current Speed sensor now shows numeric values** (0-5) instead of text
- Removed ENUM device class - now plain numeric sensor
- Added description in sensor attributes: "0=Stop, 1=Speed 1, 2=Speed 2, 3=Speed 3, 4=Speed 4, 5=Speed 5"
- Added fan icon (mdi:fan)

### Technical
- Removed STATE_MAP from ParmairSpeedControlSensor
- Changed native_value return type from str to int
- Removed _attr_device_class and _attr_options
- Added extra_state_attributes with speed description

### Display
**Before:** Shows "Stop", "Speed 1", "Speed 2", etc.
**After:** Shows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (numeric values)

## 0.7.7 - Improved Auto-Detection with Retry Logic (2026-01-05)

### Changed
- **Auto-detection now retries up to 3 times** with increasing delays (150ms, 350ms, 550ms)
- **Removed manual configuration step** - No longer prompts user to select software version or heater type
- **Uses smart defaults if detection fails** - Defaults to v1.x and no heater if all retries fail
- Detection is more reliable with longer delays between attempts

### Technical
- Added retry loop for software version detection (3 attempts with delays)
- Added retry loop for heater type detection (3 attempts with delays)
- Initial delay increased from 100ms to 150ms for device stabilization
- Retry delays: attempt 2 = 200ms, attempt 3 = 400ms
- Logs show which attempt succeeded or if defaults were used
- Removed async_step_manual_config method entirely
- Detection failures now use defaults: SOFTWARE_VERSION_1, HEATER_TYPE_NONE

### User Experience
- Configuration flow is now fully automatic
- No manual selection prompts
- Slightly longer wait during setup (up to ~1 second if retries needed)
- Integration will always succeed with detected or sensible default values

## 0.7.6 - Use Real Speed Sensor (2026-01-05)

### Changed
- **Speed sensor now shows actual running speed** - Changed from control setting to real speed
- Renamed "Speed Control" sensor to "Current Speed"
- Sensor now reads from actual speed register instead of control register
- Removed "Auto" from speed options (actual speed doesn't have auto mode)
- Speed values: Stop, Speed 1, Speed 2, Speed 3, Speed 4, Speed 5

### Technical
- Added REG_ACTUAL_SPEED constant for actual speed monitoring
- REG_SPEED_CONTROL still used for Manual Speed Control number entity
- Updated ParmairSpeedControlSensor to use actual_speed data key
- Updated STATE_MAP to values 0-5 (Stop, Speed 1-5)
- Added REG_ACTUAL_SPEED to polling registers

### What Changed
**Before:** Speed Control sensor showed the *control setting* (Auto/Stop/Speed 1-5)
**After:** Current Speed sensor shows the *actual running speed* (Stop/Speed 1-5)

**Manual Speed Control number entity** still uses control register for setting the desired speed.

## 0.7.5.1 - Remove Heater Type Control (2026-01-05)

### Removed

- Added validation: `if result and not result.isError()` before extracting register values
- Improved error handling in `_detect_device_info()`
- Detection failures now properly logged with specific error messages

### Why Detection Failed Before
1. No validation of Modbus read success - code tried to extract values from failed reads

### Fixed
- Add `device_id` keyword argument as additional fallback layer in Modbus read/write methods, supporting extremely old pymodbus builds (pre-2.0 era).
- Improve compatibility chain: `unit` → `slave` → `device_id` → attribute assignment → positional arguments.
- Reference jormai/parmair implementation patterns for legacy client handling.

## 0.1.7 - Countless Legacy Clients (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Retry Modbus reads without a count parameter after assigning legacy attributes to support the oldest pymodbus variants.
- Accept primitive read responses when legacy clients do not expose a `registers` buffer.

## 0.1.6 - Legacy Attribute Fallback (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Assign the slave/unit id through client attributes before retrying Modbus calls so extremely old pymodbus clients work during setup and polling.
- Avoid calling `isError()` on result objects that do not expose the method, preventing AttributeError on legacy responses.

## 0.1.5 - Legacy Modbus Support (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Add positional Modbus read/write fallback so very old pymodbus clients lacking both `unit` and `slave` keywords still work during setup and runtime.

## 0.1.4 - Modbus Compatibility (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Restore compatibility with deployments running older pymodbus builds by falling back to the legacy `slave` keyword when `unit` is rejected during reads or writes.
- Prevent config flow connection tests from crashing with a `TypeError` when the Modbus client lacks `unit` support.

## 0.1.3 - Model-Aware Registers (2025-12-27)

### Added
- Register metadata definitions per hardware model with placeholder support for MAC150
- Config flow model selector to ensure correct register mapping on setup
- Extra diagnostics attributes exposing register ids, addresses, and model info on fan and sensors

### Changed
- Coordinator read/write logic now scales values using register definitions instead of hard-coded addresses

## 0.1.2 - Handler Compatibility (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Resolve "Invalid handler specified" by registering the config flow domain explicitly
- Refresh README and register map to drop classified documentation references

## 0.1.1 - Config Flow Fixes (2025-12-27)

### Fixed
- Allow Home Assistant OS 2025.12+ to reuse bundled `pymodbus>=3.11.2`
- Provide translations bundle required by 2025.12 config flow loader
- Register config flow handler correctly for Home Assistant 2025.12

## 0.1.0 - Initial Release (2025-12-27)

### Added
- Initial release of Parmair Ventilation integration
