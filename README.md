## Quick Start

### Installation (3 Steps)

**1. Add to HACS**
- Open HACS → Click ⋮ (top right) → Custom repositories
- Add: `https://github.com/ValtteriAho/Hassio_Parmair`
- Category: Integration → Add
- Find "Parmair MAC" → Download
- Restart Home Assistant

**2. Find Your Device IP**
- Check your router's connected devices list
- Look for "Parmair" or "MAC" device
- Note the IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

**3. Add Integration**
- Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration
- Search "Parmair MAC"
- Enter your device's IP address
- Click Submit → Done!

> 💡 **That's it!** The integration automatically detects your device model, software version, and available features.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Connect?

**Check your IP address**
- Make sure the IP is correct (check your router)
- Device must be on the same network as Home Assistant

**Still not working?**
- Port: Should be `502` (usually auto-configured)
- **Slave ID: Must be `0` (not 1!)** ← Most common issue!
  - If you installed before February 2026, your Slave ID might be wrong
  - Delete the integration and re-add it

### Sensors Not Updating?

**Restart Home Assistant** after installing the integration.

**Some sensors missing?**
- Humidity and CO2 sensors only appear if your device has that hardware
- Check your Parmair device specifications

**Sensors showing 0 or -1?**
- This is normal! The device reports these values during calibration
- Sensors update every 30 seconds
- -1 means "calibrating" for CO2 sensors
- 0% humidity is a valid reading

### Need More Help?

[Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ValtteriAho/Hassio_Parmair/issues) with:
- Your device model (MAC80/100/150)
- Software version (visible in Home Assistant after setup)
- What's not working

## What You Get

Once installed, you'll have control over:

### Main Controls
- **Fan Entity** - Power on/off and mode switching (Away/Home/Boost)
- **Speed Presets** - Set fan speeds for each mode (Home, Away, Boost)
- **Temperature Targets** - Adjust supply and exhaust temperature setpoints
- **Timers** - Control how long Boost and Overpressure modes run

### Monitoring
- **Temperatures** - Fresh air, supply, exhaust, and waste air
- **Humidity** - Current level and 24-hour average (if equipped)
- **CO2 Levels** - Exhaust air quality monitoring (if equipped)
- **Operating Status** - Current mode, speed, and power state
- **Alarms** - Active warnings and filter status

### Smart Features
- **Summer Mode** - Automatically adjusts ventilation based on outdoor temperature
- **Time Programs** - Enable/disable scheduled operation
- **Heater Control** - Manage heating elements (see warning below)
- **Filter Tracking** - Monitor when filters need replacement

> ⚠️ **Important**: Disabling heaters via automation may void your warranty. Heaters protect against freezing - only disable if you understand the risks.

## Example Automations

### Boost When Cooking
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Boost ventilation when cooking"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.kitchen_motion
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: fan.set_preset_mode
        target:
          entity_id: fan.parmair_mac
        data:
          preset_mode: "Boost"
```

### Away Mode When Nobody Home
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Reduce ventilation when away"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: group.all_persons
        to: "not_home"
        for: "00:30:00"
    action:
      - service: fan.set_preset_mode
        target:
          entity_id: fan.parmair_mac
        data:
          preset_mode: "Away"
```

### Filter Change Reminder
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Remind to change filter"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.parmair_mac_filter_status
        to: "Replace"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Ventilation Filter"
          message: "Time to change the air filter!"
```

### Communication
- Protocol: Modbus TCP
- Default Port: 502
- Slave ID: 0 (changed from 1 in v0.9.0.5)
- Polling: Every 30 seconds (configurable 10-120s)

### Requirements
- Home Assistant 2023.1 or newer
- Network connectivity to Parmair device
- Modbus TCP must be enabled on device

### Performance
The integration reads registers sequentially with 200ms delays to prevent overwhelming the device. Updates occur every 30 seconds by default. More frequent polling may cause communication errors.

### Version Detection
The integration automatically reads:
- Hardware model (MAC80/100/150)
- Software version (1.x or 2.x)
- Heater type (Water/Electric/None)
- Available sensors (humidity, CO2)

If auto-detection fails, you can manually select these during setup.
